<h1>Hi, I'm Antwan!<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/iTakeSoulz">Cybersecurity Professional</a> | 
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/antwannephew/">Detection Engineering Enthusiast</a></h1>

After years in the SOC trenches, chasing alerts and uncovering threats, I’ve turned my focus to sharpening my skills and helping others along the way. Using Microsoft Sentinel, I’m running attack simulations, crafting clever KQL queries, and documenting the wins (and lessons learned) here. Think of this as part lab, part diary—a place to grow and share knowledge.

<h2>🚀 Ongoing Projects</h2>

- **Microsoft Sentinel Detection Lab**
  - A structured lab environment for testing and refining threat detections.
  - Goals:
    - Simulate real-world attacks using Atomic Red Team.
    - Identify detection gaps in Sentinel.
    - Build custom KQL queries and automate responses.

- **Threat Detection Playbooks**
  - Modular playbooks for SOC teams to respond to common attack scenarios.
  - Includes steps for log analysis, detection building, and automated responses.

- **Custom Threat Dashboards**
  - KQL-based dashboards to visualize detection metrics and threat insights.
  - Designed for easy integration with Sentinel.

<h2>🏅 Certifications</h2>

- **CompTIA Security+**
- **CompTIA CySA+**
- **CompTIA PenTest+**

<h2>📚 Areas of Study</h2>

- Advanced KQL for log analysis and detection.
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment for detection and response.
- Attack simulation tools (e.g., Atomic Red Team).
- Automation with Sentinel playbooks and Logic Apps.

<h2>⚙️ What’s Next?</h2>
I’m building a comprehensive Sentinel lab using real-world scenarios and detections sourced from industry best practices. Stay tuned as I document my journey and share insights into detection engineering.
